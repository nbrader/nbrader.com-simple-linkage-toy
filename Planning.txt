Bugs:
-It doesn't handle zooming the page well.
-Clicking on linkage graph still sets bar lengths but badly.
-Things aren't named well in code.

Enhancements:
-Mark boundaries of canvases with lines
-Show axes on graphs
-Give graphs zoom and pan with scroll wheel and left click+drag
-Show at least 2 length graphs (xy and xz graphs which you can click within to select a linkage and have the current linkage displayed as a point on this graph as well as the regions as is done in findings (tidy).png
-Make bar lengths enter-able in text boxes (which updates when value is changes by other parts of the app)
